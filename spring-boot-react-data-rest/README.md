# React.js and Spring Data REST

> Links are a critical facet of REST. They provide the power to navigate
> to related items. It makes it possible for other parties to navigate
> around your API without having to rewrite things everytime there is a
> change. Updates in the client is a common problem when the clients
> hard code paths to resources. Restructuring resources can cause big
> upheavals in code. If links are used and instead the navigation route
> is maintained, then it becomes easy and flexible to make such
> adjustments.

- GET - fetch the state of a resource without altering the system

- POST - create a new resource without saying where

- PUT - replace an existing resource, overwriting whatever else is already
there (if anything)

- DELETE - remove an existing resource

- PATCH - alter an existing resource partially
