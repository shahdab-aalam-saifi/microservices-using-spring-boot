# Accessing JPA Data with REST

> `@RepositoryRestResource` is not required for a repository to be
> exported. It is used only to change the export details, such as using
> `/people` instead of the default value of `/persons`.

> Spring Data REST uses the HAL format for JSON output. It is flexible
> and offers a convenient way to supply links adjacent to the data that
> is served.
